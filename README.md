Real-Time Optimized (RTO) is Refinitiv conflated real-time content, hosted in the public cloud. It provides fast and simple access to our unparalleled content from hundreds of exchanges and OTC markets around the world. We can use WebSocket APIs or Real-Time SDKs to connect to Real-Time Optimized to consume real-time content. Real-Time Optimized is maintained by Refinitiv so we don’t have control over it. It means we are unable to shut down the services to test how applications handle unexpected behaviors originated by Real-Time Optimized or Refinitiv Data Platform services.

This article demonstrates how to set up a simulated Real-Time Optimized in 3 steps to test Refinitv Real-Time SDK’s applications. It also shows how to configure and run EMA examples to connect to this simulated Real-Time Optimized environment. 

Note: This simulated environment is for development and testing purposes only.
